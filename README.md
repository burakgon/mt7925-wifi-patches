# MT7925 WiFi Fix for Linux

> **Fix WiFi disconnects, slow speeds, and instability on MediaTek MT7925 (Filogic 360) WiFi 7 chips**

## What This Does

This tool **automatically downloads, builds, and installs the latest WiFi drivers** for the MediaTek MT7925 chip from the Linux kernel's development tree (`wireless-next`). These drivers contain stability fixes that haven't reached stable kernels yet.

**One command to fix your WiFi:**
```bash
sudo ./mt76-rebuild.sh
```

No manual patching, no kernel recompilation — just run the script and reboot.

## Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 🔧 **One-Command Rebuild** | Single script downloads, builds, and installs everything |
| 🔔 **Desktop Notifications** | Get notified on login when drivers need rebuilding after kernel update |
| 📱 **App Launcher Integration** | Check patch status from KDE/GNOME app menu |
| 💾 **Auto Backup** | Original drivers backed up automatically for easy restore |
| 🔄 **Auto Update** | Script pulls latest fixes from wireless-next before building |
| 🐧 **Multi-Distro** | Works on Fedora, Ubuntu, Arch, and more |

## Symptoms This Fixes

- ❌ WiFi randomly disconnects
- ❌ Slow WiFi speeds
- ❌ WiFi won't connect after sleep/suspend
- ❌ Connection drops under load
- ❌ "No Wi-Fi adapter found" after kernel update
- ❌ High latency / ping spikes

## Supported Devices

| Device | Chip | Status |
|--------|------|--------|
| ASUS ROG Flow Z13 (2025) | MT7925 | ✅ Tested |
| ASUS ROG Zephyrus G14/G16 (2024+) | MT7925 | Should work |

## Supported Distros

Works on any Linux distro with kernel 6.x+:
- Fedora 39+ ✅ (tested on Fedora 43)
- Ubuntu 24.04+
- Arch Linux
- openSUSE Tumbleweed
- Debian Testing/Unstable
- Pop!_OS
- Linux Mint

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/burakgon/mt7925-wifi-patches.git
cd mt7925-wifi-patches

# Install dependencies (pick your distro)
# Fedora:
sudo dnf install kernel-devel kernel-headers gcc make git

# Ubuntu/Debian:
sudo apt install linux-headers-$(uname -r) build-essential git

# Arch:
sudo pacman -S linux-headers base-devel git

# Run the rebuild script
sudo ./mt76-rebuild.sh
```

## After Kernel Updates

Rebuild the driver after each kernel update:

```bash
cd mt7925-wifi-patches
sudo ./mt76-rebuild.sh
```

## Desktop Notifications (Optional)

Get notified when patches need to be reapplied:

```bash
# Autostart on login (KDE/GNOME/XFCE)
mkdir -p ~/.config/autostart
cp mt76-check.desktop ~/.config/autostart/

# Add to app launcher
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/applications
cp mt76-status.desktop ~/.local/share/applications/
```

## How It Works

1. Downloads the `wireless-next` kernel tree (latest WiFi driver development)
2. Builds mt76 driver modules for your kernel
3. Replaces stock modules with patched versions
4. Backs up original modules for easy restore

## Verify It's Working

```bash
# Check modules are loaded
lsmod | grep mt79

# Check custom marker exists
ls /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/drivers/net/wireless/mediatek/mt76/.custom-mt76
```

## Restore Stock Drivers

```bash
cd mt7925-wifi-patches
sudo cp -r ./backup-modules/* /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/drivers/net/wireless/mediatek/mt76/
sudo depmod -a
sudo reboot
```

## Troubleshooting

**Build fails with "kernel headers not found"**
```bash
# Fedora
sudo dnf install kernel-devel-$(uname -r)

# Ubuntu
sudo apt install linux-headers-$(uname -r)
```

**WiFi still not working after install**
- Reboot your system
- Check `dmesg | grep mt79` for errors
- Open an issue with your logs
